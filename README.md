## Installation

```bash
composer require swissup/module-marketplace
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Usage

First, you need to [get your access keys](#where-do-i-get-my-identity-keys)
from the channel you'd like to use. When you get the keys, proceed to
[CLI-based](#command-line-interface) or [GUI-based](#magento-backend-interface)
section.

### Command line interface

 1. Activate update channel and enter access keys:

    ```bash
    bin/magento marketplace:channel:enable
    ```

 2. Install the package(s) you need:

    ```bash
    # Download and enable module:
    bin/magento marketplace:package:require <package/name>
    # Run one-click installer (if module provides it):
    bin/magento marketplace:package:install <package/name>
    ```

 3. That's all. Check your store frontend now!

    > Some modules requires additional configuration after installation.
    > Please refer to the module documentation.

### Magento backend interface

 1. Navigate to _System > Tools > Marketplace_ page.
 2. Open **Configuration** panel, activate and add access keys to the
    channel you'd like to use.
 2. Search for the module you'd like to install, and press **Install** button.
 3. That's all. Check your store frontend now!

    > Some modules requires additional configuration after installation.
    > Please refer to the module documentation.

## Extending Marketplace

### Register your update channel

Custom update channels are registered via separate module with `di.xml` file
instructions. See following examples:

 - [Magento Marketplace](https://github.com/swissup/module-marketplace/blob/master/etc/di.xml#L73-L109)
 - [Swissup, Firecheckout, Argento](https://github.com/swissup/module-marketplace/blob/master/etc/di.xml#L111-L151)
 - [Private channel as separate module](https://github.com/swissup/module-marketplace-channel-github)

### Create one-click installer

One-click installer is registered with `etc/marketplace/installer.xml` file.
See following examples:

 - [Absolute Theme](https://github.com/swissup/theme-frontend-absolute/blob/master/etc/marketplace/installer.xml)

## Troubleshooting

### Web Setup Wizard is not accessible

If you see 'Marketplace: Web Setup Wizard is not accessible' error in browser
console, this means that _System > Tools > Web Setup Wizard_ is not working correctly.
(We use it to read logs while store is in maintenance mode.)

To fix this issue change Magento configuration as shown below:

 -  General > Web > Base URLs (Secure):
    -   Use Secure URLs on Storefront: Yes
    -   Use Secure URLs in Admin: Yes
    -   Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Yes
    -   Upgrade Insecure Requests: Yes

## FAQ

### Can I install modules from the packagist?

Yes. But via CLI only.

### Can I install modules from private repository?

Yes. But via CLI only. Here is an example:

```bash
# 1. Add your private repository to the composer.json
composer config repositories.<id> vcs https://github.com/repo/url.git

# 2. Setup auth data. Get token at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo
bin/magento marketplace:composer:auth github-oauth.github.com <token>

# 3. Use marketplace to download the module and run installer (if any)
bin/magento marketplace:package:require <package/name>
bin/magento marketplace:package:install <package/name>
```

### Where do I get my identity keys?

#### Magento Marketplace customers

[marketplace.magento.com](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/)
page.

#### Swissuplabs, Firecheckout, and Argentotheme customers
