## Installation

```bash
composer require swissup/module-marketplace
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Usage

First, you need to [get your access keys](#where-do-i-get-my-identity-keys)
from the channel you'd like to use. When you get the keys, proceed to
[CLI-based](#command-line-interface) or [GUI-based](#magento-backend-interface)
section.

### Command line interface

 1. Activate update channel and enter access keys:

    ```bash
    bin/magento marketplace:channel:enable
    ```

 2. Install the package(s) you need:

    ```bash
    # Download and enable module:
    bin/magento marketplace:package:require <package/name>
    # Run one-click installer (if module provides it):
    bin/magento marketplace:package:install <package/name>
    ```

 3. That's all. Check your store frontend now!

    > Some modules requires additional configuration after installation.
    > Please refer to the module documentation.

### Magento backend interface

 1. Navigate to _System > Tools > Marketplace_ page.
 2. Open **Configuration** panel, activate and add access keys to the
    channel you'd like to use.
 2. Search for the module you'd like to install, and press **Install** button.
 3. That's all. Check your store frontend now!

## Extending Marketplace

instructions. See following examples:

 - [Swissup, Firecheckout, Argento](https://github.com/swissup/module-marketplace/blob/master/etc/di.xml#L111-L151)
 - [Private channel as separate module](https://github.com/swissup/module-marketplace-channel-github)

### Create one-click installer

One-click installer is registered with `etc/marketplace/installer.xml` file.
See following examples:

 - [Absolute Theme](https://github.com/swissup/theme-frontend-absolute/blob/master/etc/marketplace/installer.xml)
